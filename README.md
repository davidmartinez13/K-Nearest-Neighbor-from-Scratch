# K nearest neighbor algorithm for iris plant classification
KNN algorithm implemented from scatch. The used dataset is the iris plant dataset to clasify betwen the Iris-Setosa, Iris-Versicolour, Iris-Virginica based on with and height of their petals and sepal. It includes 3d visualization of clusterring and classification.
